💡 AI-Powered Recommendation System
An intelligent and efficient Recommendation System built using machine learning techniques. This project demonstrates how AI can personalize user experiences through item-based recommendations, similar to those used by platforms like Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify.

🚀 Features
🔍 Content-Based Filtering – Recommends similar items based on attributes.

🧠 Machine Learning Integration – Leverages Scikit-Learn for training models.

📊 Interactive Interface – Uses Streamlit for a clean and responsive web UI.

📁 Scalable Codebase – Modular Python scripts for easy scaling and customization.

📈 Data-Driven – Powered by real-world datasets for practical insights.

🔍 How It Works
Load Dataset – Products, titles, and metadata are loaded.

Vectorization – Content is transformed into a matrix using CountVectorizer.

Similarity Calculation – Cosine similarity identifies closest items.

Recommendation – Based on input, the top N most similar items are displayed.
